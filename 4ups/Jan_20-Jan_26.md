# 4up for January 20th through January 26th.
 
## What did we do?
- Added formatting standards and processes to the project repository.

## What are you going to do?
- Hold our first demo of the semester and outline the sponsor's key pirorities for this upcoming semester.

## What is holding us up?
- We still have yet to set up some critical meetings with the sponsors which will allow us to continue development on some key goals for the semester.

## What risks do we see?
- It may take some time for some of our non-regular sponsor meetings to happen because of availability or other blockers.
