# 4up for October 12th through October 18th.
 
## What did we do?
1. Got a start on implementing increased radius for color target rotation

## What are you going to do?
1. Verify the processing pipelines correctly handle greater rotation. See if there is a feasible fix to resizing a rotated color target.

## What is holding us up?
1. Nothing at the moment.

## What risks do we see?
1. Lots of current issues are frontend-related and the frontend codebase seems hard to work with. 
A real risk that the team may decide it is best to rewrite the frontend to fix these issues and make the project more maintainable.
