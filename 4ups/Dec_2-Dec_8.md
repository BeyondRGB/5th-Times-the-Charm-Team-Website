# 4up for December 2nd through December 8th.
 
## What did we do?
- We got in our last official code changes for the semester
- We delivered our semester presentation

## What are you going to do?
- Have a very reflective, honest, and thoughtful retrospective to talk out how we can improve for next semester.
- Possibly prepare a release for all that we have done this semester
- Some team members may work on the project occasionaly over break

## What is holding us up?
- No further project development for this semester, but nothing holding us back anyways for when second semester starts.

## What risks do we see?
- Some team members will likely not work on the project and enjoy the break, so it may take some time to get into the swing of things when we return.
