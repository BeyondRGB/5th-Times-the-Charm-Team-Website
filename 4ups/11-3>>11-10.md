# 4up for November 3rd through November 10th.
 
## What did we do?
1. We finished sprint 2, which brought lots of smaller bug fixes and nice to haves.
2. We completed two of the core asks from the sponsor, Auto Sorting name notices & Rotatable Color Targets.

## What are you going to do?
1. We are going to start sprint 3, and poker plan the bugs we found during our weekly meeting.

## What is holding us up?
1. We broke building on macOS and windows with the introduction of the stacktrace library.
2. Our builds are broken on macOS. This was an oversight during the PR process for switching to C++23 & the stacktrace library.
3. Parker can’t run the app after recent changes, and he hopes it doesn’t hold back for long.

## What risks do we see?
1. We may find issues with implementing a new stacktrace library.
2. We have a massive PR to handle, and it is going to take a good bit of our time.
