# 4up for February 10th through February 16th.
 
## What did we do?
- Got some progress on this sprint's items.

## What are you going to do?
- Put in our best effort to finish this sprint's items for the next demo.
- Handle some sponsor feedback such as making the releases on the BeyondRGB website more understandable.

## What is holding us up?
- Nothing from a project standpoint, only the team finding time to work on the project during this busy point of the semester. 

## What risks do we see?
- Midterms are taking a lot of the team's focus. It is possible some items may not be ready for next week's demo.
