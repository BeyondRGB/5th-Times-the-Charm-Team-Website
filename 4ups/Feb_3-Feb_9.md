# 4up for February 3rd through February 9th.
 
## What did we do?
- Confirm key items of our backlog for the rest of the semester
- Finish some key milestone items so that we stay on track for the goals of this team project.

## What are you going to do?
- Confirm with the sponsor about pirorites of the remaining key items we plan to do
- Confirm with sponsor about where the project is headed after our depature, so, for example, we may take extra steps to improve the project's maintainability after RIT Senior Projects.

## What is holding us up?
- There is plenty to work on and the team is humming.
- Sometimes pull requests are open for longer periods of time which would be nice to shorten up.
- Some additional communication may be needed for items like ICC Max, but that will be tackled when that work item is picked up.

## What risks do we see?
- with somewhat long pull request times, there has been some spillover from previous sprints and we see that happening again if we can't shore it up
