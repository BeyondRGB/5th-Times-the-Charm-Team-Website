# 4up for September 29th through October 5th.
 
## What did we do?
- Estimated and investigated more issues we found
- Completed spike investigations into existing items we don't have a good understanding of
- Resolved various leftover setup issues preventing us from starting development

## What are you going to do?
- Finish up the last of the spike investigations
- Determine the best approach for some of the bigger work items (such as state management)
- Start working on some of the highest pirority work items

## What is holding us up?
- We need to assess how difficult the state management issues are to fix, as the project's frontend is using an older version of a tool which has limited features. However, the alternatives aren't promising

## What risks do we see?
- State management issues will take longer than anticipated due to upgrading the frontend or using the existing structure, which either way could be a painful process
- Fall Break and Career Fair will slow down development as the team's pirorities might temporarily shift
