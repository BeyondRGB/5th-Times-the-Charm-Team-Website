# 4up for September 8th through 12th.
 
## What did we do?
1. Went over issues and bug reports from the previous team.
2. Sent a message to Adam Kropf to get access to a sheet with additional bugs.
3. We generated a list of questions for our sponsors.
4. We started to generate process standards for the project.
5. We met with our sponsor for the first time and discussed the scope of the project.
6. We went over the materials presented to us in a later meeting.

## What are you going to do?
1. Reviewed the issues in the spreadsheet provided to us.
2. Find the issues in the spreadsheet in the codebase and understand their scope.
3. Find any new issues in the codebase that aren't represented by the spreadsheet.
4. Fill out the unpointed Kanban with this.
5. Present them Tuesday, discuss them, then
6. Planning Poker Thursday.

## What is holding us up?
1. Websocketpp was removed from the VCPK repositories, and the workaround broke Linux support. Switching to a git-submodules-based approach could solve this.
2. Building on non-Windows devices.
3. We do not have access to a spreadsheet (we requested it from the owner).

## What risks do we see?
1. Releasing BeyondRGB on macOS will require signing the code. This requires a $99 per year developer account from Apple.
2. The frontend is written in an old version of Svelte; this may cause issues when updating it.
3. We don't get access to the spreadsheet.
4. We have a slurry of build problems that prevent us from adequately exploring the issues.
