# 4up for September 22nd through 25th.
 
## What did we do?
1. Backend now runs on macOS, Linux, & Windows.
2. Frontend now builds on Windows. Verifying the changes on other platforms.

## What are you going to do?
1. Set up a headless Windows machine so we can build the backend (we do not have a lot of Windows machines).
2. Taylor and Jack are going to look into Svelte state handling.
3. Raynard and Jakob will be looking into error handling on the backend.

## What is holding us up?
1. Nothing related to the project at this moment, see risks though.

## What risks do we see?
1. We may have to change our Svelte version. This means a lot of changes that could extend development time.
2. We have midterms and a career fair coming up. This could affect how much we do.
