# 4up for January 13th through January 19th.
 
## What did we do?
- Most team members did not work over break, so this first week was spent getting refamaliarized with the project and with the team's development process.
- We made some minor edits to the README and improved our installation scripts.
- Some team members did get a good start on the current sprint's items.

## What are you going to do?
- Start off the semester on a good note by completing the items in the first sprint of the semester.
- Connect with sponsors on their expectations and goals for the semester and come up with the best plan to achieve that.

## What is holding us up?
- Nothing at this moment aside from connecting with sponsors next week to confirm the prioritization of remaining itmes.

## What risks do we see?
- It may take some time for team members to adjust to their schedules or to the project itself.
