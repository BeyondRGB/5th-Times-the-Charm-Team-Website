# 4up for November 11th through November 17th.
 
## What did we do?
1. We discussed the possibility of adding a co-op to the project next semester, but feel it is not feasible because of an insufficient amount of work.
2. We have been working on getting some big structural changes finished so that the rest of the team can build upon them for Sprint 3.
3. We estimated some new bugs and work items that the sponsors and the team found.

## What are you going to do?
1. We are going to continue our sprint 3 items, ideally capped off with a release to the sponsors.

## What is holding us up?
1. There is a big UI change that is going through review right now which is fundamental for future changes. 

## What risks do we see?
1. None at this time.
