# 4up for September 15th through 21st.
 
## What did we do?
1. We did sprint poker
2. We are working on building for all platforms
3. We have labeled all of our sprints
4. We know what to talk to our sponsor about for more information.

## What are you going to do?
1. Continue working on backend build issues, for Linux & Mac.
2. Continue working on frontend build issues on Windows.

## What is holding us up?
1. Frontend does not build on windows because of a python node error.
2. Backend is only set up for building on Windows, we are working on a submodule approach to fix builing for all platforms.

## What risks do we see?
1. Releasing BeyondRGB on macOS will require signing the code. This requires a $99 per year developer account from Apple.
2. We are worrying about state management in Svelte and we will be spiking on this.
