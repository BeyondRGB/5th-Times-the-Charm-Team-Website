# 4up for October 19th through October 25th.
 
## What did we do?
1. We finished our first sprint.
2. We fixed the settings screen style.
3. We fixed general CSS and appearance issues.
4. We fixed a state bug, that caused the Image View and Image Report screens to not properly update when a new image was processed.
5. We logged a variety of bugs and issues found in the app, such as a rotated color target shape not resizing properly.

## What are you going to do?
1. Plan our second sprint and receive input on the first sprint.
2. Pick up and familiarize with the next highest-pirority items for next sprint.

## What is holding us up?
1. None at this moment.

## What risks do we see?
1. Currently the line between a frontend consideration to be fixed now versus a consideration for sveltekit is not clear.
