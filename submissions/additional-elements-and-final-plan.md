## Project Goals / Scope
BeyondRGB aims to deliver a user-friendly application for processing spectral image data for cultural heritage photography—focusing on reliability, usability, and maintainability. The pipeline includes RAW ingestion, dark-current/flat-field corrections, channel registration, calibration from checker targets, and outputs of color-managed images, spectral cubes, and accuracy reports. This year emphasizes:
- Clearer error messages
- Dependency modernization
- Optional OpenQualia QR support
- Improved target selection/verification
- Stability for high-res files
- Better calibration visualizations
- Flexible export formats
- Reproducibility, documentation, and frictionless museum workflows

The companion website hosts plans, metrics, meeting notes, and artifacts, updated biweekly.

## Major Deliverables
- Error handling robustness
- Error reporting
- Efficiency for large images
- Target rotation
- Bug fixes
